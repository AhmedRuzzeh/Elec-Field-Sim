# ⚡ Elec-Field-Sim

An interactive **electric field simulator and calculator** built with **Python**, **Flask**, **JavaScript**, and **HTML/CSS**.  
It allows users to **input multiple charges** with their positions and magnitudes, then **visualizes the resulting electric field** and calculates the field magnitude at each charge.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖊️ **Add multiple point charges** with custom position and charge values
- 📊 **Calculate** electric field magnitude at each charge
- 📈 **Visualize** electric field lines and charge distribution
- 💻 Interactive and easy-to-use web interface

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Other:** Matplotlib (for visualization), NumPy (for calculations)

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed  
- Pip (Python package manager)

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AhmedRuzzeh/Elec-Field-Sim.git  
cd Elec-Field-Sim

---

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

### 4️⃣ Run the Flask app
python app.py

---

### 5️⃣ Access the app  
Open your browser and go to:  
http://localhost:5000/

---

## 📸 How It Works
1. Enter **x** and **y** coordinates (in meters) for each charge  
2. Enter the **charge magnitude** (in Coulombs)  
3. Click **Submit** to:
   - View the **electric field magnitude** at each point
   - See a **graphical representation** of the electric field
